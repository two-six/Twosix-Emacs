* TwoSix Emacs
TwoSix Emacs is a distraction-free emacs distribution which main mission is to provide a minimal, distraction-free(who would've guessed) Emacs Experience. Project is still in very early stages, so I wouldn't recommend using it as your normal day-to-day Emacs Distribution yet.

The only external dependency (for now) is the [[https://www.ibm.com/plex][IBM Plex]] font, which can be easily changed in config.org.

* TODOs
- Add an automatic install command for this configuration
- Search for more dark disctraction-free themes
